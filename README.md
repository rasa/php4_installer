the PHP Manual (English) in Windows Help (CHM) Format, and the Zend Optimizer,
which are available at http://www.php.net, and http://zend.com.

php_installer also performs the following:

* copies php.ini-recommended to php.ini and sets the following settings:
````
  extension_dir="C:\Program Files\php4\ext"
  error_log="C:\Program Files\php4\logs\phperror.log"
  upload_tmp_dir="C:\Program Files\php4\uploads"
  session.save_path="C:\Program Files\php4\sessions"
````

* Adds the following variables to your environment:
````
   PHPRC=C:\Program Files\php4
````

* Adds the installation directory to your PATH environment variable.
	On 32-bit systems, this directory is usually `C:\Program Files\PHP`.
	On 64-bit systems, this directory is usually `C:\Program Files(x86)\PHP`.

php_installer looks in the directory where php_installer.exe is for
any files it needs before attempting to download them. If it does download a
file, it will attempt to save a copy of the file in this same directory.
